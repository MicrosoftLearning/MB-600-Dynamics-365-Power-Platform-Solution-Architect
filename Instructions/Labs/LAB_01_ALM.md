**Module 8: Application Lifecycle Management**
==============================================

**Lab Scenario**
----------------

In this hands-on lab, you are an administrator for Contoso, helping them adopt
the Power Platform.

The team building the “Device Order Management” app is now ready to transport
the solution from their development environment to the test environment for
testing.

In this lab, you will be using Azure DevOps and the Power Apps build tools to
automate checking the solution into a source control repository and then use
that to deploy to test and production environment.

**Lab Test Environment**
------------------------

You will be assigned one or more users to use to complete the tasks. As this is
a shared environment, some tasks that require a tenant Global Administrator or a
Service Administrator role will have already been performed.

**Exercise 1: Initialize Azure DevOps**
---------------------------------------

In this exercise, you will be signing up for an Azure DevOps account and
configuring the Power Apps build tools for the account.

**Note:** If you already have Azure DevOps outside of this course and this
environment, you **CANNOT** use that here. You will need to follow the below
instructions to sign up.

### **Task 1: Signup for Azure DevOps**

1.  Log on to <https://dev.azure.com> and click **Sign into Azure DevOps;** use
    the credentials from your instructor.

2.  Provide your credentials and click **Next**.

3.  Provide a **Password** and click **Sign in**.

4.  Click **Continue**.

5.  Provide a unique **Azure DevOps Organization** name such as lastnameMMYY,
    select a location closest to your tenant, enter captcha and click
    **Continue**. *Replace lastname with your last name, MM current month and YY
    current year.*

    **Note:** For some users, this page has a heading “We need a few more
    details”. Ensure that you enter the organization name and not miss this
    step.

6.  Enter **Device Management lastnameMMYY** for **Project Name** and click
    **Continue**. *Replace lastname with your Last name, MM with current month,
    and YY with current year.* Select **Private** for **Project Visibility**. This will take 3-7 seconds to configure and
    navigate to the Project’s Home page.

7.  Projects are containers in Azure DevOps that track work items and source
    assets. When you set up the automation for the deployment tasks, those will
    be pipelines built in the context of a project.

8.  Select **Repos \| Files**.

9.  An Azure Repo is a source/version control container inside the Azure DevOps
    project and is used to track changes you make. You will be using it to store
    the solution files for the team building the Device Ordering app.

10. Scroll down and check the **Add a Readme** checkbox and then click
    **Initialize**.

### **Task 2: Configure Power Apps Build Tasks**

1.  Log on to <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/azuredevops>

2.  Search for **PowerApps**.

3.  Select **PowerApps BuildTools**.

4.  Click **Get it Free**.

5.  Select the **Azure DevOps** organization you created and click **Install**.

6.  Click **Proceed to Organization**. This will open a new tab for the project.

7.  Click to open the **Device Management lastnameMMYY** project you created.

8.  Click **Project Settings** in the bottom left corner of the Azure DevOps.

9.  Select **Repositories** in the settings pane.

10. Navigate to the **Permissions** tab then select **Project Collection Build Service Accounts**

11. Locate **Contribute** and set it to **Allow**.

12. Search for **Project Collection Build Service** and select the Project Collection without Accounts at the end of the name.

13. Locate **Contribute** and set it to **Allow**.

**Exercise 2: Build Export Pipeline**
-------------------------------------

In this exercise, you will build an Azure DevOps pipeline that will export the
solution from the development environment, unpack the solution file to
individual files and then check those files into the repository. These solution
files can then be used to re-create development environments or promote the
solution to test/production.

### **Task 1: Export Solution**

    2.  Make sure you still have the **PowerApps Export Solution** task

        Ensure that there are no white spaces while entering the above values.

    3.  Choose **Both** for Type of Solution.

10. Allow scripts to access the OAuth Token. This will allow the commands you
    will add to check in files to the Azure DevOps repo to work. **This is a very important step which if skipped will cause the pipeline to fail**.

        Management lastnameMMYY** project.

    2.  Select **Pipelines**.

    3.  Click to open the pipeline.

    4.  Click **Run Pipeline**.

    5.  Click **Run** again and wait.

        open it.

2.  Review the Repository.

    1.  Select Repos.

    2.  You should see **ContosoDeviceOrderManagement** folder. Click to open
        the folder.

    3.  You may examine the content of each folder.

**Exercise 4: Build Manage Solution and Publish Artifacts**
-----------------------------------------------------------

In this exercise, you will take the solution files checked into the repo in the
previous steps and re-package them into a managed solution file. This solution
file will be published as a build artifact so it can be used in the release
pipeline that we are going to use to publish to test and production.

In a real project this is where you could add steps to import the solution into
a build Common Data Service environment to check for missing dependencies. You
could also add build tasks to run tests against your solution as well as run
PowerApps Solution Checker to detect problems. In this lab exercise we will skip
those extra steps to ensure you have enough time to complete the lab.

**Exercise 5: Build a Release Pipeline**
----------------------------------------

In this exercise, you will build a release pipeline. The release pipeline is
intended to take the output from the build pipeline and coordinate deployments
to one or more release environments. A common release pipeline might deploy to
dev -\> test -\> user acceptance -\> production. Release pipelines can have
approval requirements between each environment.

For the purposes of this lab we are only going to deploy to one test
environment.
